##### `express.json()` 
- is middleware provided by the Express framework that parses incoming requests with JSON payloads. When a client sends a POST or PUT request with a JSON payload, this middleware parses the JSON data and makes it available in the request.body property. It essentially allows the server to handle JSON-formatted data in the request body.
